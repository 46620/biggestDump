## biggestDump
Open Source Switch Update Dumper based on [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV)'s code.

## Info
biggestDump will dump pending updates from your Nintendo Switch's NAND to SDMC. Once it is complete, you can use [ChoiDujourNX](https://gbatemp.net/threads/choidujournx-a-system-firmware-installer-homebrew-for-the-nintendo-switch.513416/) to install them without burning your fuses. Update data is dumped to **sdmc:/Update/**. Locate this folder in ChoiDujourNX and you're done.
